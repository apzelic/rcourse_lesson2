# Introduction
Here we will present some of the results of the frequency of the name *Page* over time.  Let's see if we can display just the head of some of the data

```{r, echo=FALSE, results = 'as is'}
head(data_clean)
knitr::kable(head(data_clean), format = "html", digits = 2)
```




# Results


## Prevalence by Year
Below is a plot for how the proprtion of people with the name "Page" (log base 10 transformed) has changed over time.  Overall the trend is pretty flat, with maybe a slight increase over tiem

```{r, echo=FALSE}

```
